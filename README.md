possible incorrect arduino IDE json link

This link has a json that works

https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32

The json for the arduino IDE is Note: ```main```` instead of ```master```

USB-C cable issue. It has to be pushed all the way in. not really obvious

Check windows device manager both the com-ports and the Universal serial bus controllers
In the com ports it might show both the regular serial port and the STM32-bootloader  the Universal serial port only shows the ST loader showing up on some windows computers. I am using win11
